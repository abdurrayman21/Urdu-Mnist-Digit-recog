## Overview
The goal of this project is to build a robust Urdu numeral recognition model using deep learning techniques. The repository contains code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. By the end, the model will be able to accurately recognize handwritten Urdu digits, providing insights into OCR tasks for the Urdu language.

## Dataset
This project uses an Urdu version of the MNIST dataset, containing grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9) in Urdu script.

- **Image Size**: 28x28 pixels, grayscale
- **Classes**: 10 (digits 0–9 in Urdu)

The dataset can be downloaded from [Link to Dataset Source] (update this link as needed).
